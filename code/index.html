             <p> So what is the mening of the term back-end? Well, back-end has a buddy called front-end.
                Front-end and back-end are terms used in information technology to denote the processing done by or near the user (user interface-oriented processing - front-end) and the basic processing itself (often at the server level - back-end). So to simplify, the back-end is what happens behind the scenes if the scene is the web.
                Thus front and back-end collaborate in dynamic web pages. You don't have to be a genius to figure out that a front-end developer is working on writing front-end code, and that a back-end developer writes code on the back-end. A full-stack developer is someone who writes both front- and back-end code.</h5>
